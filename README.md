# Student Mental Status Analysis
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student mental health, specifically exploring aspects related to treatment, panic attacks, and depression. Through the use of visualizations and data analysis techniques, the project aims to uncover insights into potential dependencies and patterns within student mental health data.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-mental-health-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd student-mental-health-analysis
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains anonymized information about student mental health, including variables such as treatment status, occurrences of panic attacks, and levels of depression. The dataset is provided in a CSV format and can be found in the data directory.

# Usage
Ensure that you have installed all the dependencies.
Run the Jupyter notebook student_mental_health_analysis.ipynb to perform the analysis.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, create visualizations, and analyze the data.
Analysis
# The analysis includes:

Data cleaning: Removing missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations (plots, numbers) to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
Statistical analysis: Calculating summary statistics and identifying dependencies and patterns in the data.
# Results
The project aims to provide insights into student mental health, such as:

The prevalence of treatment among students.
The frequency of panic attacks and their correlation with other factors.
The relationship between depression levels and academic performance.
# Future Work
Future work on this project could involve:

Incorporating additional datasets to validate findings.
Developing predictive models for identifying students at risk of mental health issues.
Implementing interventions based on the analysis to support student mental health.
